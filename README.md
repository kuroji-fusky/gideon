# Gideon

As a standalone package, it's a wiki parser and scraper used specifically to scrape Fandom wikis but generally should work fine for any wiki that runs on MediaWiki software.

It offers out-of-the-box parsing for common templates, but custom templates, such as tabs for related pages won't have a exact 1:1 replica as, at this time, it only parses the rendered HTML and not its Wikitext provided.
